## Masterâ€™s Project Report

Here you have a latex report template.

You have to submit an **individual report**. The report should contain 50 pages for a teamwork project and 30 pages for an individual project. For team projects, the individual report must contain a final appendix where the contribution of each of the team members should be detailed.

The report should contain a link to the project Github repository.
