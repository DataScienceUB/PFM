## Title: Agent-based models for assessing the risk of default propagation in interconnected sectorial financial networks

Advisor: Jordi Nin

Description: 
Interconnected sectorial financial networks are the substrate for economic agents. One of the main questions nowadays is to understand how systemic risk can raise in financial network. Systemic risk is understood as the probability of large cascades of entangled economic events triggered by causes that range from exogenous shocks to endogenous defaults. The succession of defaults can jeopardize the full system. The interplay between the topology of the underlying interaction network and the easiness of events to propagate has proven to be essential to understand the proportion of the financial system affected by default avalanches and to assess the systemic risk. Avalanches in financial systems are understood as dynamical processes that correlate individual economic states of the agents when a triggering stress event materializes.
In this project students should design a set of different autonomous agents able to interact in a financial network. Then, perform a set of experiments in a simulated sectorial financial network to find the most efficient behavior when an economic crisis raise in a financial network

The project will be developed by 3 students with the following tasks:
- Network data generation (Student 1)
- Agent-based model implementations (min 1 model, ideally 3) (Students 1-3)
- Simulation execution (Student 2)
- Results analysis (Student 3)
- Report writting  (Student 1-3)
- Optional: Scientific Publication  (Student 1-3)
