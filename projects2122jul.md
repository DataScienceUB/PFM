| ? | Ground-based Cloud Classification with Deep Learning (CCN vs Transformers) | Jordi Vitrià (jordi.vitria@ub.edu), Gerard Gómez (UB) | <sub> Clouds play an essential role in the circulation of water vapour and affects the earth’s energy balance. In the study of weather forecasting and climate change, clouds are always regarded as the core factor. The traditional cloud observation is much dependent on the observers’ experience, and thus, it is time-consuming. We propose to develop a neural net for accurate ground-based meteorological cloud classification. To this end, we will explore CCN as well as Transformer architectures.  </sub>|

| ? |  Exploring Machine Learning Devops alternatives. | Eloi Puertas Prats (epuertas@ub.edu) | <sub> + One of the most difficult stages in the DataScience Pipeline is to put into production trained models and make them work in real life applications. Machine Learning Devops tries to solve these problems by following the learned rules from Software Engineering and deploying models using automatization.  In this project we will explore different alternatives to create a full automatized devops pipeline in a classic DataScience project, from collecting data from different sources (bots, crontabs….)  to train online models, deploy them and finally putting into production using a containerized web application.  The main goals of the project are: * Full automatization in the DataSicence Pipeline, no further human interaction is needed once the project is deployed.  * Daily Models Building, the model is retrained every day when new train data is available. * Dashboard for controlling which models are in production at any time. * Data Version Control, like Version Control System, but with the data fetched for the application. * Continuous Machine Learning, train new models continuously and updating them directly to production, retrieving the metrics obtained during the training. * Connectors to Tensorflow visualization toolkit. The principal tool we going to use is Github, Github Actions and python scripting. Platforms to explore: https://cml.dev/  https://dvc.org/  https://studio.iterative.ai/ Requeriments:  1 Student, Strong skills using Github and python scripting.

| ?   |      Crowd learning from any type of information  |  Jerónimo Hernández González (jeronimo.hernandez@ub.edu), Aritz Pérez (BCAM) (aperez@bcamath.org) | <sub> Crowdsourcing approaches to machine learning aim to obtain data from a community of collaborators who are not required to be experts or knowledgeable in the project in which they participate. Among others, this type of (altruistic or paid) workers has been commonly used to label datasets. Different methods have been proposed for learning from this type of data [1], frequently assuming a model of workers’ behavior. Most of these models assume that the information provided by the workers is just a label, although several studies show that it is possible to take advantage of more vague information of supervision. In this work, the student will work on the learning from crowdsourced data problem where the information provided by workers can take any form. An appropriate model for the workers in this new framework needs to be conceived. The objective is to propose a whole learning technique that leads to robust classifiers when dealing with this type of data, in comparison with the standard approach to learning from crowds.

| ?   |  Mental health estimation with data coming from multiple sources  |  Jerónimo Hernández González (jeronimo.hernandez@ub.edu) |  <sub>  Data collection is arguably one of the principal factors constraining the use of machine learning in many domains, including health care. It is a laborious task which takes physicians’ time, and that is why it is considered as expensive. In other cases, when analyzing diseases with reduced prevalence, it is simply hard to obtain cases for a robust study from one single hospital. Thus, in practice in many studies, data is collected by several hospital or health care centers. This comes with a cost: not always the collection of data is performed exactly in the same way. Thus, the benefit of having more data for learning is traded-off with the accuracy of the method on data from every single center. In this work, the student will work with a real-world application where the objective is to predict a mental health issue in a dataset of patients from 5 different health care centers. The objective is to use specific techniques from multiple-source learning [1] in order to overcome the performance of a classifier learned with the whole dataset, as well as selecting carefully the performance metrics that should be taken into account - Requirements:  •	Python •	No. students: 1 -  Bibliography: Crammer, K., Kearns, M., & Wortman, J.
