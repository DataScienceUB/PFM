| ? | Ground-based Cloud Classification with Deep Learning (CCN vs Transformers) | Jordi Vitrià, Gerard Gómez (UB) | <sub> Clouds play an essential role in the circulation of water vapour and affects the earth’s energy balance. In the study of weather forecasting and climate change, clouds are always regarded as the core factor. The traditional cloud observation is much dependent on the observers’ experience, and thus, it is time-consuming. We propose to develop a neural net for accurate ground-based meteorological cloud classification. To this end, we will explore CCN as well as Transformer architectures.  </sub>|

| ? |  Exploring Machine Learning Devops alternatives. | Eloi Puertas Prats (epuertas@ub.edu) | <sub> + One of the most difficult stages in the DataScience Pipeline is to put into production trained models and make them work in real life applications. Machine Learning Devops tries to solve these problems by following the learned rules from Software Engineering and deploying models using automatization.  In this project we will explore different alternatives to create a full automatized devops pipeline in a classic DataScience project, from collecting data from different sources (bots, crontabs….)  to train online models, deploy them and finally putting into production using a containerized web application.  The main goals of the project are: * Full automatization in the DataSicence Pipeline, no further human interaction is needed once the project is deployed.  * Daily Models Building, the model is retrained every day when new train data is available. * Dashboard for controlling which models are in production at any time. * Data Version Control, like Version Control System, but with the data fetched for the application. * Continuous Machine Learning, train new models continuously and updating them directly to production, retrieving the metrics obtained during the training. * Connectors to Tensorflow visualization toolkit. The principal tool we going to use is Github, Github Actions and python scripting.
