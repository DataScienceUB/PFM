| ? | Exploring Machine Learning Devops alternatives. | Eloi Puertas Prats (epuertas@ub.edu) | One of the most difficult stages in the DataScience Pipeline is to put into production trained models and make them work in real life applications. Machine Learning Devops tries to solve these problems by following the learned rules from Software Engineering and deploying models using automatization.  In this project we will explore different alternatives to create a full automatized devops pipeline in a classic DataScience project, from collecting data from different sources (bots, crontabs….)  to train online models, deploy them and finally putting into production using a containerized web application.  The main goals of the project are: * Full automatization in the DataSicence Pipeline, no further human interaction is needed once the project is deployed.  * Daily Models Building, the model is retrained every day when new train data is available. * Dashboard for controlling which models are in production at any time. * Data Version Control, like Version Control System, but with the data fetched for the application. * Continuous Machine Learning, train new models continuously and updating them directly to production, retrieving the metrics obtained during the training. * Connectors to Tensorflow visualization toolkit. The principal tool we going to use is Github, Github Actions and python scripting. Platforms to explore: https://cml.dev/  https://dvc.org/  https://studio.iterative.ai/
