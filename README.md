# Master on Fundamentals of Data Science: Final Project

## Guidelines to Master’s Project Proposal

The Master Project can be **individual** or a **teamwork project** of a maximum of 3 students working on the same subject.
Projects will naturally be expected to require an effort proportional to the number of team members (300 hours per student). Students may choose a project from a list of suggested projects (see below) or propose one of their own ideas. 

### Stages of Development of Master’s Project
+ Form a team of 2-3 students if you want to develop a teamwork project.
+ Write a prioritized list of projects. 
+ The Master’s Project Coordinator, Laura Igual (`ligual@ub.edu`) will assign you a project, by looking for a (maybe global) maximum of the function that represents your global preferences. 
+ Discuss the research questions, goals, approach you intend to take, methodology, data needed and time plan with your project supervisor.  
+ Construct a logical outline for the project. Include analysis steps and expected outcomes. 
+ For temwork projects, **define a clear role for all members of the group**. 
+ Fill in details of the project + role definition in a short document (max 2 pages). 
+ Hand in this document to your supervisors and start the project development! 

The final project delivery must include:
+ all code produced in a GitHub (or similar) software repository.
+ a project report (see the Report Template directory).

### Project Assessment
The quality of the projects will be graded by using three sources of information:
+ The delivered information at the end of the project.  We will use a [“Project Evaluation Rubric”](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1g9foCpIxRSuA414hjeqWZNniJl_QC81W2x0P44_kngw/edit?usp=sharing) to assign an individual mark to each member of the project. 
+ The public presentation of your project. Your presentation should be professional enough to give at a technical conference (e.g. organized approach, prepared slides, a short demo or video if appropriate). 

### Calendar (2021/2022)
+ Dec TBD: Publication of a list of suggested projects. 
+ Jan. TBD: Deadline for sending your project priorities. Please, fill in [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfQAFki1YXuK37cjgrIT52hnwF60kLAkh_SlsRVBnmoQ0GXOw/viewform?usp=pp_url)
+ Jan. TBD: Assignment of projects & supervisors to student groups.
+ Feb. TBD: Limit for delivering the project proposal short document to your advisor.
+ Feb TBD: - Jul. TBD: Period of development of your project.
+ Jun. TBD: Limit for informing if you will present the TFM in July or September.
+ Jul. TBD & Set. TBD: Limit for final delivery of your project (via Campus Virtual task).
+ Jul. TBD & Set. TBD: Presentations.

### List of Suggested Projects

+ [Projects 2021/2022](projects2122.md)

### Master’s Project Report

+ Use the latex report template available in this repository.
+ **Every student has to submit an individual report**, even for a teamwork project. In this last case, the report should have a different title specific for every member of the teamwork project and some parts can be different depending on the role of the author.
+ For teamwork projects, the report should contain a final appendix where the contribution of each of the team members should be detailed. Each member will be evaluated based on this information.
+ The report should contain:
  + between **45-55** pages for a teamwork project.
  + between **25-35** pages for an individual project.
  + Reports that do not meet these length limits will not be accepted.
+ The report should contain a link to the project Github repository.
+ Delivery should be only digital by Campus Virtual.

### Guidelines for the Project Deliveries

#### Formal requirements for the TFM document:
+	[Here](http://www.ub.edu/cub/criteri.php?id=2176) you can find the style guide Interuniversity Style Guide for Writing Institutional Texts in English which aims to facilitate interuniversity communication and improve the quality of the institutional English-language documents we produce for international readers. 

#### Guidelines for code documentation in GitHub:
+	For the basic structure of your GitHub you can use [Cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
+	You can find Notebook examples [here](https://github.com/DataScienceUB/introduction-datascience-python-book).
+	For non-publicable projects: use private [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/) repositories.


### Master’s Project Presentation:

+ Presentations will be 20 minutes for individual projects, 30 minutes for projects of 2 students and 40 minutes for projects of 3 students, followed by 10 minuts of questions.
