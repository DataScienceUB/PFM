# Master on Fundamentals of Data Science: Final Project

## Guidelines to Master’s Project Proposal

In most of the cases, the Master Project is a teamwork project of `n` students working on a subject. Individual projects can also be considered. Projects will naturally be expected to require an effort proportional to the number of team members (300 hours per student). Students may choose a project from a list of suggested projects (see below) or propose one of their own ideas. 

### Stages of Development of Master’s Project
+ Form a team of 1-5 students.
+ Choose the prioritized list of projects. 
+ The Master’s Project Coordinator, Jordi Vitrià (`jvitria@ub.edu`) will assign you a project, by looking for a (maybe global) maximum of the function that represents your global preferences. 
+ Discuss the research questions, goals, approach you intend to take, methodology, data needed and time plan with your project supervisor.  
+ Construct a logical outline for the project. Include analysis steps and expected outcomes. 
+ Define a clear role for all members of the group. This role will be considered in your personal student assessment.  
+ Fill in details of the project + role definition in a short document (max 2 pages). 
+ Hand in this document to your supervisors and start the project development! 

The final project delivery must include:
+ all code produced in a GitHub (or similar) software repository.
+ a project report (see the Report Template directory). 
+ a high level description of the completed project (jupyter notebook and/or blog entry).

### Project Assessment
The quality of the projects will be graded by using three sources of information:
+ The delivered information at the end of the project.  We will use a [“Project Evaluation Rubric”](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1g9foCpIxRSuA414hjeqWZNniJl_QC81W2x0P44_kngw/edit?usp=sharing) to assign a mark to the project.
+ The public presentation of your project. Your presentation should be professional enough to give at a technical conference (e.g. organized approach, prepared slides, a short demo or video if appropriate). 
+ [Peer-evaluation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iYwW6xOXSaQ9ApzYHpk-GdLONF9VGV17rOod2ifFkQs/edit?usp=sharing). Team members will assess other members of the team as well as themselves. Peer assessment provides data that will be used in assigning individual grades for team members.

### Master’s Project Report

+ Use the latex report template available in this repository.
+ The report should contain 50 pages for a teamwork project and 30 pages for an individual project.
+ The report should contain a link to the project Github repository.
+ For team projects, the report should contain a final appendix where the contribution of each of the team members should be detailed.
+ Delivery should be only digital by Campus Virtual.

### Guidelines for the Project Deliveries

#### Formal requirements for the TFM document:
+	[Here](http://www.ub.edu/cub/criteri.php?id=2176) you can find the style guide Interuniversity Style Guide for Writing Institutional Texts in English which aims to facilitate interuniversity communication and improve the quality of the institutional English-language documents we produce for international readers. 

#### Guidelines for code documentation in GitHub:
+	For the basic structure of your GitHub you can use [Cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
+	You can find Notebook examples [here](https://github.com/DataScienceUB/introduction-datascience-python-book).
+	For non-publicable projects: use private [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/) repositories.


### Master’s Project Presentation:

+ Presentations will be 20 minutes for individual projects, 30 minutes for projects of 2 students and 40 minutes for projects of 3 students, followed by 10 minuts of quetsions.
