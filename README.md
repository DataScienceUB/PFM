# Master on Fundamentals of Data Science: Final Project

## Guidelines to Master’s Project Proposal

In most of the cases, the Master Project is a teamwork project of 3 students working on a subject. Individual projects can be 
considered only in special cases. Projects will naturally be expected to require an effort proportional to the number of team members (300 hours per student). Students may choose a project from a list of suggested projects (see below) or propose one of their own ideas. 

### Stages of Development of Master’s Project
+ Form a team of 3 students.
+ Choose the topic for your Master’s Project in collaboration with Master’s Project Coordinators (jordi.vitria@ub.edu & ligual@ub.edu). 
+ Discuss the research questions, goals, approach you intend to take, methodology, data needed and time plan with your project supervisor. 
+ Construct a logical outline for the project. Include analysis steps and expected outcomes. 
+ Define a clear role for all members of the group. This role will be considered in your personal student assessment.  
+ Fill in details of the project + role definition in a short document (max 2 pages). 
+ Hand in this document to your supervisors and start the project development! 

The Master Project must be concluded before 1/7/2018. 

The project delivery must include:
+ all code produced in a GitHub repository.
+ a project report (see the Report Template directory). 
+ a high level description of the completed project (jupyter notebook and/or blog entry)

### Project Assessment
The quality of the projects will be graded by using three sources of information:
+ The delivered information at the end of the project.  We will use a [“Project Evaluation Rubric”](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1g9foCpIxRSuA414hjeqWZNniJl_QC81W2x0P44_kngw/edit?usp=sharing) to assign a mark to the project.
+ A presentation of your project. Your presentation should be professional enough to give at a technical conference (e.g. organized approach, prepared slides, a short demo or video if appropriate). 
+ [Peer-evaluation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iYwW6xOXSaQ9ApzYHpk-GdLONF9VGV17rOod2ifFkQs/edit?usp=sharing). Team members will assess other members of the team as well as themselves. Peer assessment provides data that will be used in assigning individual grades for team members.
